This section includes about all of the things that related to this website project.

## Web and Domain Design Goals

This website is designed to provide two things, **sandboxing** my program using the subdomain of this domain, and creating a good **personal web** at `adhinata.dev` that can be accessible to anyone who wants to know about me.

### 1. Sandboxing

My apps or a private backend that serve as a subdomain will host using my beloved-and-old-reliable Android Phone. With SD636 SOC and 3GB of RAM in it, that should be fine for handling decent requests around 50 users/second due to internet quota limitation.

But for ready production backend or apps that will handle more than 100 requests per second, I will use either my beefy PC or online paid VPS such as Azure, Google Cloud, or AWS (not priority, I prefer free VPS if available).

### 2. Personal Web

Then, my public personal website that using main domain will be hosted online using an additional free provider like Netlify, Github Pages, or Vercel (priority). This conclusion chooses by two things. First, flexibility to develop website from anywhere, thanks for CI/CD from Github/GitLab. Second, reserving my monthly internet quota.

## Features

This is some feature that I will add to my website:

- Portfolio, with link to my social media account.
- Better font readability
- Low end mobile, and slow connection friendly
- Better SEO
