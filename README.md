This section includes about all of the things that related to this website project.

## Web and Domain Design Goals

This website is designed to provide two things, as my **playground** for create my own apps, and creating a good **personal web** at `adhinata.dev` that can be accessible to anyone who wants to know about me.

## Technology behind my personal web

-   Frontend:
    -   Next JS -> js metaframework, for frontend, SEO, and built-in Router
    -   Tailwindcss -> styling
    -   Radix -> for accessibility and the faster way to create polymorph component
-   Back End :
    -   Vercel
